This paper is divided into three sections. The first section focuses on modeling the dynamics of a pandemic. The model embeds several parameters, which we estimate in order to explore the nature of the dynamics of a pandemic. We explore the timing of a generic shelter-in- place order to control growth of infection. In section 2 we use real data from Santa Clara County, CA to identify system parameters and validate the model. In section 3 we use the validated model for Santa Clara County to examine strategies for scaling back the shelter-in-place order, predicting the future of the pandemic.
